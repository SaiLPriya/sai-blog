# 🧮 Two Sum — Blind 75

The **Two Sum** problem is one of the most popular algorithm questions.  
We are given an array of integers and a target number. We need to find two numbers that add up to the target and return their indices.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`,  
return *indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`*.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution,  
and you may not use the same element twice.


### Example

```text
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9  
Output: [0, 1]
````

Explanation:
Because `nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9`

---

## ⚙️ Approach — Hash Map

We can solve this efficiently using a **Hash Map**.

1. Loop through the array.
2. For each number, check if the complement (`target - num`) exists in the map.
3. If it exists, return both indices.
4. If not, store the number and its index in the map.

This gives us **O(n)** time complexity and **O(n)** space.

---

## 💻 Code (JavaScript)

```javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  const map = new Map();

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const complement = target - nums[i];

    if (map.has(complement)) {
      return [map.get(complement), i];
    }

    map.set(nums[i], i);
  }
}
```

## 🧾 Example Walkthrough

For `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]`, `target = 9`

| Step | i | nums[i] | complement | map before | Result |
| ---- | - | ------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------- |
| 1 | 0 | 2 | 7 | \{\} | store (2 → 0) |
| 2 | 1 | 7 | 2 | \{2 → 0\} | found complement → return [0,1] |

---


## 🧩 Output

```text
[0, 1]
```

---

## ⏱️ Complexity

* **Time Complexity:** O(n)
* **Space Complexity:** O(n)

---

## ✅ Summary

* Use a Hash Map to track seen numbers.
* Check for complement before inserting.
* Efficient and clean — perfect for interviews.
